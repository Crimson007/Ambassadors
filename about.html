    <h1>Historical Background</h1>
    <p>
        The Ambassadors of Hope foundation has its roots traced from a group of visioned youths from Nyandarua County
        who were fortunate to be practitioners of Kirinyaga University. Here is where the dream of the Foundation was
        concieved and brought to life in the yaer 2022 on September. Unfortunately, there was no name given to the group
        at that time as it was just a charity group. These youths were able to collect enough contribution from their
        pocket money and savings to visit and feed children. Not to mention, they entertained them leaving a permanent
        mark in their hearts. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Following this event, the group finally realised their potential and they entertained the idea
        of a registered and formal organisation that could engage in charity, welfare and volunteer activities in the society.
        The Chairman, Mr. Thibu Samwel, envisioned such an organisation and inspired the group to move in that direction.
        He founded the group officialy by branding the name: "Ambassadors of Hope" and even coming up with the group's 
        policies and constitution. This happened on 2023 January, marking the beginning of a new chapter.
    </p>
    <h2>What we Do</h2>
    <p>
        Since then, the group has been actively recruiting other similar minded individuals who seek to better our society
        and bring hope where it has diminished. The Ambassadors of Hope visit every member of the society, from orphans,
        street children, special homes, prisons and other needy members of the society. We give these members hope by visiting
        them, sharing meals, playing or engaging in bonding activities and also through our contributions.<br>
        We also make merry-go-round contributions among members to equip the group with security in case of the unfortunate event
        of illness, death or desperate need of money of one of our members.
